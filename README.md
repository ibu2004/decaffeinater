# decaffeinater
This thing is for people who just spend way too much time gaming when they should be utilizing time for more productive purposes. This app fixes that. Essentially, select the time, select the app, and use the app until decaffeinater automatically kills it, lol. Kinda hardcore but hehe.

Built with React and Electron, for those who want to know.

### Advance warning: not ready for production.

## Installation
Right now we are about to use electron-builder to package this app, but right now they aren't ready. So you need to set up a development environment and get it working.

## Setting up a dev environent.
Setting up a development environent requires Node.js. [Click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download the latest LTS version (Current also works though) of node.js for Windows and macOS, and [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install the newest version of node.js on most Linux distributions.

Next, download the code in this repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/ibujs/decaffeinater/archive/master.zip) and unzip it in a folder, or simply clone this repository.

Finally, open a terminal window in the folder where the app is located and execute the following commands (with an internet connection):
```
> npm install
> npm start
```
